			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The dynamic elements of the website will be: An array of vacations or memories that hold dates, descriptions, images, etc. Filtering will allow vacations or memories with
                certain conditions to be viewed like date, location, or category.  Memories with more than a single image attached will have the ability to click through by pressing arrows
                or if the image is clicked they will be able to scroll through all the images. A light/dark mode toggle. There will also be condtional logic that will show seasonal messages
                and also allow the user to mark a favorite trip, which will change the appearance of the memory.
